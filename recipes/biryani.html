    <h2> DESCRIPTION </h2>
        <p> 
            Biryani is a celebrated rice dish made with aromatic spices, meat (chicken, mutton, or beef), or vegetables.
            Originally derived from the Persian word birian (meaning "fried before cooking"),it was refined in the royal 
            kitchens of the Mughal Empire and has since evolved into dozens of regional varieties across the Indian subcontinent.

    <h2> INGREDIENTS </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>Rice</li>
            <li>Protein</li>
            <li>Spices</li>

        </ul>

    <h2> STEPS </h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Marinate the Protein: Mix your chicken or mutton with thick yogurt, ginger-garlic paste, salt, turmeric, red chilli powder, and biryani masala. For best results, let it rest for at least 2 hours or overnight.</li>
            <li>Prepare the Rice: Wash aged basmati rice until the water runs clear, then soak for 30–60 minutes. Boil water with whole spices (bay leaf, cardamom, cloves, cinnamon) and cook the rice until it is only 70% done—it should have a slight bite.</li>
            <li>Fry the Onions (Birista): Thinly slice onions and deep-fry them until they are a deep golden brown and crispy. Set these aside for layering and garnish.</li>
            <li>Cook the Meat Base: Heat ghee or oil in a heavy-bottomed pot. Sauté whole spices and marinated meat until it is browned. Add a little water if needed and cook until the meat is about 80% tender</li>
            <li>Layer the Biryani: Spread half of the cooked meat gravy at the bottom of the pot. Cover with a layer of par-boiled rice. Sprinkle fried onions, fresh mint, coriander, and saffron-infused milk. Repeat the layers if you have extra ingredients.</li>
            <li>The Dum (Slow Steam): Seal the pot tightly using a lid and a damp cloth, or by using a dough seal around the edges to trap the steam. Cook on the lowest heat for 15–20 minutes.</li>
            <li>Rest and Serve: Turn off the heat and let the biryani rest undisturbed for 15–30 minutes. This allows the flavors to settle and the moisture to redistribute through the rice grains.</li>
        </ol>
